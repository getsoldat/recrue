## Installing

recrue is bundled and installed automatically with Soldat. You can run the Soldat > Install Shell Commands menu option to install it again if you aren't able to run it from a terminal (macOS only).

## Thanks to Atom !

recrue bundles [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm)  and is built from [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm)

A big thanks to them for all the works done. [TBC]
